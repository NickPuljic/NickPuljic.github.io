Welcome to my home page!  My name is Nick Puljic and I'm currently a junior at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences studying Computer Science on the Intelligent Systems track (AI, ML, robotics). I'm currently working to add more information about myself, but in the meantime feel free to check out my [resume](https://nickpuljic.github.io/NicholasPuljicResume.pdf) and get in [contact](https://nickpuljic.github.io/contact) with me if interested!
